# riddle scraper
This is a simple scraper I made to harvest riddles from riddles.fyi
This code has too much semantics for it to be general purpose, but you should be able to at least use the selenium one to scroll and capture elements of a certain element name. 
If edited, it could be adapted to other purposes

# Requirements
Check any imports used in the python files and install them using pip3.
A 'config.py' file of the format:
	path_to_chromedriver = "/PATH/TO/CHROMEDRIVER"
Chromedriver is an executable file used to control Chrome. check it out at https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/ and download it onto your computer to use for scraping.
